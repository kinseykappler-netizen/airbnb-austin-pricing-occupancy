## Executive Summary

Our analysis used **3,040 Austin Airbnb listings** to explore what drives nightly pricing.  
We compared two models: a simple **linear regression** and a more flexible **random forest**.  

- The **linear model** explained only **27%** of price variation (RÂ² = 0.27) with an average error of about **$120/night**.  
- The **random forest** performed much better, explaining **71%** of variation (RÂ² = 0.71) with an average error closer to **$87/night**.  

This suggests that pricing in Austinâ€™s Airbnb market is influenced by complex, non-linear relationships best captured by more advanced models.

The most decisive factor was **price per guest**, far outweighing all other features.  
Amenities, bed configuration, and review scores played smaller roles, while **Superhost status had minimal impact**.

## Host Briefing: What Drives Nightly Price

For Austin hosts, the single strongest driver of price is **how many guests a property accommodates relative to cost**.  
Travelers pay close attention to *value per person*, not just the flat nightly rate.  

Other insights:  
- Adding more amenities or achieving high review scores matters somewhat, but their influence is modest.  
- Surprisingly, **Superhost status** alone does not significantly raise price.  

### Recommendations for Hosts
- Optimize listings around **price per guest** â€” e.g., emphasize group-friendly layouts or flexible sleeping arrangements.  
- Highlight amenities, but know that they add **incremental rather than decisive value**.  
- Maintain good review scores to stay competitive, but donâ€™t expect them alone to justify higher prices.  
- Donâ€™t rely on Superhost status as a pricing lever; focus on **perceived value and guest capacity** instead.

## Neighborhood Insights

Analyzing neighborhood averages revealed clear differences in nightly pricing across Austin.  
The **most expensive neighborhoods** command significantly higher rates, driven by proximity to downtown, nightlife, and cultural attractions. In contrast, outer residential areas tend to offer lower nightly prices and larger homes, catering more to groups looking for value per person.  

Interestingly, the **gap between top and mid-tier neighborhoods** was wide, suggesting that location is a critical driver of guest willingness to pay, even more so than review scores or host status. For hosts, emphasizing neighborhood advantages (walkability, access to entertainment, quiet family-friendly areas) can be as important as listing-level features when positioning a property.  

For travelers, these insights suggest trade-offs: downtown convenience comes at a premium, while exploring outside the city center can unlock much better per-person value â€” especially for larger groups.

## ðŸ“… Occupancy Insights

By analyzing booking calendars, we estimated **occupancy rates** (the share of days each listing is booked vs available).  

- The **majority of listings** fall in the middle range (30â€“70% occupancy), reflecting a mix of part-time hosts and professional operators.  
- A small share of **high-demand listings** consistently show >80% occupancy, often clustered around downtown or popular tourist areas.  
- On the other end, many listings are booked **less than 20% of the time**, suggesting oversupply or hosts who operate only occasionally.  

For hosts, this means that **achieving high occupancy is rare** and usually tied to either great location or competitive pricing. For travelers, low-occupancy listings may signal more availability and potential for discounts, while high-occupancy ones indicate popular, trusted properties.  

These findings underline that **location and pricing strategy together drive booking frequency** more than status labels or amenities alone.
